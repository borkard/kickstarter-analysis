## Analysis and Challenges
Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Analysis of the Outcomes Based on Launch Date was conducted by creating a pivot table to count the number of theater campaigns per outcome (successful, failed, canceled) by month

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
o	Explain Challenges or difficulties that were encountered, and how they were overcome, are well explained. If there were no difficulties, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered (2 pt).

THE ABOVE IS JUST A DESCRIPTION. PROVIDE AN ANSWER.

## Results

From the Outcomes based on Launch Date, it can be concluded that May is an ideal month in which to launch a theater campaign as the highest number of successful campaigns are launched in May; over double  the number of failed campaigns. December is not an ideal month in which to launch a theater campaign because the number of successful and failed campaigns begin to even out. In the realm of Kickstarter campaigns, theater is a good category in which to launch a campaign because there are a high number of successful campaigns year-round and very few that are cancelled.

The Outcomes based on Goals shows that all campaigns fail if the goal is between $45,000-$50,000. Additionally, very few campaigns succeed when the goal is set over $50,000. Based on the Outcomes based on launch date, it is ideal to...
